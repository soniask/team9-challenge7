1. 
  1. Our app allows a user to search for their favorite Kanye song. The lyrics for the song will be displayed and you will be able to choose from pre-determined blocks of lyrics to decide which one is your favorite. For each song the top 5 favorite lyrics will be displayed to you. As more users vote the top/best lyrics will become more solidified and apparent.
  
  2. Any fan of Kanye will love using our app. The only downside is not being able to favorite every lyric!

  3. The main features of the website would be making an account/logging in, searching songs/displaying lyrics, and saving and displaying results for the most liked lines in a song.

2. Our project will use the Kanye REST API to find lyrics for a given song, firebase to save lyric rankings per song, and bootstrap for styling purposes.
